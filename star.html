            Kavin's performance in "Star" shines brightly, capturing the essence of an artist's struggle with a compelling narrative that resonates deeply. Directed by Elan, the film is a poignant portrayal of ambition and resilience, set against the backdrop of the Tamil film industry. Yuvan Shankar Raja's music elevates the emotional core of the story, while Lal's portrayal of a supportive father adds depth to the narrative. The film's surprises and twists keep the audience engaged, culminating in a satisfying climax that leaves a lasting impression. "Star" is a testament to the power of dreams and the unyielding human spirit. Overall, it's a must-watch that scores a solid 5/5.</li>
